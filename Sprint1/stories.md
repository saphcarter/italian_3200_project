### Definitions

<p>Stories: A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer. User stories are a few sentences in simple language that outline the desired outcome. They don't go into detail. Requirements are added later, once agreed upon by the team.</p>

<p>Epics: Large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (called stories).</p>

<p>Initiatives: Collections of epics that drive toward a common goal. (likely too large for this project scope)</p>

### Our project stories

<p>Template: “As a <strong>person<strong>, I [want to]... __so that__...”</p>

<ul>

<li>As a beginners Italian student I want to take quizzes to give me feedback on my Italian pronunciation and improve my speaking confidence.</li>

<li>As an Italian professor I want to be able to see my student's test results so I can see if they are learning/progressing their skills.</li>

<li>As an Italian professor I want to be able to create new quizzes so that I can assess different language levels of Italian.</li>

</ul>

Our epic is essentially the project brief.
